    "FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is an open-source library developed by Facebook AI Research for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It is widely used in machine learning and information retrieval applications where you need to find similar items in a dataset, such as images or documents."

    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "FAISS is a powerful tool for similarity search and is easy to set up using Python. With its support for both CPU and GPU, FAISS scales well for handling large datasets. In this example, we demonstrated how to create an index, add vectors, and perform a similarity search efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "To go further, you can experiment with different FAISS indices, such as `IndexIVFFlat` for faster searches on larger datasets or use GPU acceleration to handle millions of vectors.\n",
