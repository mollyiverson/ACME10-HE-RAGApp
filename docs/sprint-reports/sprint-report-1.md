# Sprint 1 Report (8/26/2024 - 10/5/2024)

## What's New (User Facing)
* Completed Project Description
* Completed Requirements and Specifications
* Created user stories, use cases, and a traceability matrix for tying user stories with functional requirements
* Completed three courses on RAG development related to implementing vector search with knowledge graphs
* Completed a course on RAG development with Javascript
* Completed tutorials on React development and FastAPI
* Created a demo knowledge graph with DBPedia and SPARQL

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
In this sprint, our team focused on defining and refining the core requirements of the RAG application by gathering and analyzing client input. We held regular meetings with the client to clarify expectations, which helped us structure the project through user stories, use cases, and UML diagrams. We divided the workload effectively using a Kanban board and worked individually on key components like functional requirements and system evolution. One of the main barriers we faced was understanding how to integrate knowledge graphs and vector search for RAG functionality, but by completing online courses and collaborating as a team, we overcame these challenges and made progress in both technical learning and project planning.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
* Effective client communication: Regular client meetings helped clarify project expectations and led to more accurate requirement gathering.
* Collaborative teamwork: The team used the Kanban board effectively to manage tasks, ensuring balanced contributions and timely completion.
* Skill development: Team members successfully completed online courses related to vector search, knowledge graphs, and full-stack web development, enhancing our technical capabilities for RAG implementation.

Here's what we'd like to improve:
* Requirement clarification early on: Some initial challenges in fully understanding the client's expectations led to delays, so earlier and more detailed communication will be prioritized.
* Time allocation for learning: Balancing project work with individual learning could be better managed to avoid time crunches toward the end of the sprint.
* Faster integration of tools: It took longer than expected to understand how to integrate vector search and knowledge graphs, so a more structured approach to integrating new tools is needed.

  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
* Improved time management for technical learning: Team members will allocate specific time blocks for skill development to prevent overlaps with project work.
* Prototyping focus: Begin coding and prototyping the RAG model earlier in the sprint to ensure more testing and iterations before the final presentation.
