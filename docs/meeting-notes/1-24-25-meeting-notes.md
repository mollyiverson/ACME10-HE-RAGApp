## **2. Meeting Summary**

### Introduction:
- Started with informal chatting and catching up.  
- Reviewed the goals for this sprint and overall project direction.  

### Client’s Requirements:
- The client emphasized focusing on core functionality rather than a fully polished application. The primary objective is to develop a solid foundation for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with key components working efficiently.  
- Given that only two coding sprints remain, the client advised structuring tasks strategically to maximize progress.

### Key Discussion Points:
- **Sprint Priorities:** Reviewed the main deliverables for this sprint, ensuring they align with long-term project goals.  
- **Team Member Contributions:**  
  - **Adam**: Expanding dataset creation beyond Wikipedia documents to provide more diverse and useful retrieval data.  
  - **Chandler**: Researching and implementing optimal chunking strategies for processing large datasets efficiently.  
  - **Molly**: Setting up and refining system testing to validate different components of the application.  
  - **Ethan**: Transitioning from LLaMA to ChatGPT for improved response generation and integration with existing architecture.  
- **Scaling Wikipedia Embeddings:** Discussed increasing the number of rows used in embeddings beyond the initial 100-row limit to evaluate improvements in performance and accuracy.  
- **System Pipeline & Storage:** Clarified the role of vector database storage within the RAG pipeline, ensuring the pipeline retains original queries for the LLM while effectively utilizing embeddings for retrieval.  
  
### Decisions Made:
- **Expand Dataset Scope**: Increase dataset size for embeddings and analyze performance improvements.  
- **Maintain Strategic Focus**: Prioritize first three tasks from the last semester's task board for this sprint while keeping lower-priority tasks flexible.  
- **Finalize LLM Transition**: Replace LLaMA with ChatGPT for response generation.  
- **Refine Testing and Debugging**: Continue strengthening system testing for robustness.

### Action Items:
- **Action 1**: Expand dataset chunking and evaluate retrieval performance – Due by **01/28/2025**.  
- **Action 2**: Complete transition from LLaMA to ChatGPT and validate integration – Due by **01/28/2025**.  
- **Action 3**: Ensure system testing framework is in place – Due by **01/28/2025**.
