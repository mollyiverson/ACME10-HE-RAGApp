# **Minutes of Meeting**

**Project Name**: ACME10-HE-RAGApp  
**Client Name**: HackerEarth (CEO Vikas Aditya)  
**Date**: 2/21/25  
**Time**: 10:30 am - 10:45 am PST  
**Location**: Zoom

**Attendees**:
- Vikas Aditya  
- Adam Shtrikman  
- Molly Iverson  
- Ethan Villalovoz

## **1. Agenda**
- Present the current implementation with a demo to the client.
- Discuss enhancements for the custom dataset: graphs, images, and CSV parsing.

---

## **2. Meeting Summary**

### Introduction:
- The meeting began with brief introductions from the project team.
- An overview was provided of the current state of the application.

### Client’s Requirements:
- Enhance the current custom dataset implementation with advanced features such as graphs and images.
- Due to a git branch issue, the demo was unsuccessful; the client requested to view our Sprint 4 Demo Video as a supplement.

### Key Discussion Points:
- **Sprint Priorities:**  
  - Reviewed the main deliverables for this sprint, showcasing performance metrics and current implementation speed compared to previous versions.
- **Team Member Contributions:**  
  - **Adam**: Discussed and sought feedback on further developing the custom dataset functionality.  
  - **Chandler**: Discussed the chunking implementation.  
  - **Molly**: Presented performance metrics.  
  - **Ethan**: Discussed rebuilding new embeddings containing the full dataset.

### Decisions Made:
- **Complete Full Embeddings Generation with the Wikipedia Dataset:**  
  - Prioritize this task during the final coding sprint to allow our RAG model to address a wider array of queries.
- **Begin Deployment Work:**  
  - Start packaging and deployment efforts during the final coding sprint.
- **Improve Vector Search Ranking:**  
  - Implement a ranking mechanism to deliver more relevant responses to users.

### Action Items:
- **Action Item 1**: Compile the custom dataset and prepare it for embeddings – Due by **3/6/25**  
- **Action Item 2**: Improve vector search ranking – Due by **3/6/25**  
- **Action Item 3**: Embed the full Wikipedia dataset with retrieval instructions – Due by **3/6/25**  
- **Action Item 4**: Begin app packaging and deployment – Due by **3/6/25**
