## **2. Meeting Summary**

### Introduction:
- The project team (Ethan Villalovoz, Molly Iverson, Chandler Juego, and Adam Shtrikman) provided an update on the current sprint and upcoming milestones.
- Discussion focused on requirements and the evolving nature of the project.

### Client’s Requirements:
- The client emphasized the importance of having a mini milestone plan with one goal per week.
- Requirements for the project look good, but experimentation and testing are key for the success of the project due to the rapidly evolving technology space.

### Key Discussion Points:
- **Discussion Point 1**: Technology stack exploration
    - Team discussed using SQLite and Python for the backend.
    - FastAPI was chosen to handle the backend infrastructure, while React will be used for the frontend.
- **Discussion Point 2**: Knowledge graph and its implementation
    - The client explained the central focus of the project will be the novelty of the knowledge graph and the need to download an API for this purpose.
    - Discussions were held on how the knowledge graph can be applied to real-world applications and its role in the RAG app for generating relationships between data.
- **Discussion Point 3**: Fact-checking using the knowledge graph
    - Team explored ways to use the knowledge graph for fact-checking and determining what relationships should be passed into the generation process.

### Decisions Made:
- Agreement to finalize the exploration of vector search tools.
- Confirmation to use FastAPI for the backend and React for the frontend.
- Client stressed the importance of ongoing testing and experimentation.

### Action Items:
- Team to further explore vector search options and present findings in the next meeting – Due by 10/08/2024.
- Continue experimenting with the knowledge graph API and discuss the relationships that can be integrated into the RAG app – Ongoing.
