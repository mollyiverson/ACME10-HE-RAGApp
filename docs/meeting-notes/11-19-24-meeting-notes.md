## **2. Meeting Summary**

### Introduction:
- Brief summary of Sprint 3 plans

### Client’s Requirements:
- Discussion on database tools to use for keep embeddings and user data
- Current challenge with processing user input into SPARQL queries for DBpedia

### Key Discussion Points:
- **Discussion Point 1**: Storing Embeddings data: Vikas recommended we use SQLite (vss extension) or [MeiliSearch\(https://www.meilisearch.com/). We should embed a small portion of the Wikipedia dataset once and store it forever in the database. We can store both the Wikipedia dataset and embeddings.
- **Discussion Point 2**: Vector Search pipeline: Vector search with embeddings and text search and comparing the results. The most relevant results will be found in both methods. We can use a heuristic to rank the results and pass them to the LLM to generate a response.
- **Discussion Point 3**: Natural language processing: it's difficult to process more complex commands that have multiple entities and relationships (e.g. Who is the father of Abraham Lincoln?). Vikas recognized that this is a complex topic and we could dedicate a whole sprint toward it. Companies have products solely dedicated toward it.

### Decisions Made:
- We should first aim for 10,000 embeddings using SQLite or MeiliSearch.
- We can focus more on improving processing user input next semester. It's a very complex process. It's more important to set up embeddings instead.


### Action Items:
- Integrate VS and LLM in the RAG pipeline due by 11/28/24
- Prepare presentations due by 12/2/24
- Store 10,000 embeddings by 11/28/24
