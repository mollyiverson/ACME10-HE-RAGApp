## **2. Meeting Summary**

### Introduction:
- Started with informal chatting and catching up.
- Reviewed the capstone project goals, emphasizing interests and achievable milestones.

### Client’s Requirements:
- The client emphasized encouraging team interests and recognized that a full-fledged application may be difficult to achieve within the timeline. Focus should remain on delivering key components.
- With only two coding sprints remaining, it was suggested to focus on core deliverables and structure tasks accordingly.

### Key Discussion Points:
- **Task Prioritization**: Focus on the first three tasks from the last semester task board, spreading them across the remaining sprints. Other tasks can be deprioritized if time is limited.
- **Wikipedia Embeddings**: Current progress on embedding the full Wikipedia text was reviewed. Suggested increasing the dataset size beyond the current 100 rows to test performance improvements.
- **Vector Database Storage**: Discussed pipeline clarifications for vector database storage and confirmed that original queries will be used for the LLM. Addressed slight confusion on whether embeddings (numerical data) were being passed directly to the LLM.
- **Final Deployment Goals**: Aim for project results to include some form of deployment.
  
### Decisions Made:
- Increase the dataset size for embeddings beyond 100 rows and evaluate performance.
- Focus on completing the first three tasks of the last semester task board in the remaining sprints.
- Deprioritize lower-priority tasks unless additional time allows.
- Clarify pipeline functionality for vector database storage and ensure proper query handling.

### Action Items:
- **Action 1**: Complete the current sprint – Due by 2/10/2025.  
- **Action 2**: Add full embeddings to the README and test new performance – Due by 2/10/2025.

## **3. Project Milestones**
- Add full embeddings link to README and switch LLaMA to Chat GPT by 1/24/2025

---

## **4. Next Steps**
- Increase embedding dataset size and test performance.
- Complete first three tasks on the last semester task board.
- Prepare for upcoming presentations.
