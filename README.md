# ACME10-HE-RAGApp

## Project summary

### One-sentence description of the project

We will develop a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application for [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/) that will utilize vector search, knowledge graphs, and a LLM to answer questions and generate content from a knowledge base of more than 10,000 Wikipedia articles.

### Additional information about the project

- **Client:**
  - [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/), based in San Francisco, offers enterprise software for technical hiring. Organizations use their platform to create coding assessments, conduct remote video interviews, and ensure unbiased, AI-powered evaluation of candidates.
- **RAG application:**
  - Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) means supplying a Large Language Model (LLM) with the appropriate processed data from an outside knowledge base. We will use Knowledge graphs and vector search to optimize data retrieval. 
- **Potential Knowledge Graph tools:**
  - DBpedia, YAGO, or other knowledge graphs (KG) of your choice, and use SPARQL to query the KG.
- **Potential vector search tools:**
  - FAISS, Annoy, Pinecone, or other vector search libraries.
- **Potential LLMs:**
  - OpenAI, or free models such as Microsoft Phi, Smaller version of LLaMA, etc.
